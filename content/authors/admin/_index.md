I am an evolutionary geneticist and postdoctoral researcher in the [Gaut lab](https://www.gautlab.bio.uci.edu) in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at UC Irvine.  

My research interests include plant genome evolution, the genetic basis of complex traits, and comparative genomics. My current projects are focused on studying the evolution of grape crop wild relatives.  

I did my PhD in the [Koenig lab](https://sites.google.com/ucr.edu/koeniglab/home) in the Department of Botany and Plant Sciences at UC Riverside.
