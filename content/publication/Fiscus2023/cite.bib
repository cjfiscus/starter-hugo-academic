  abstract = "Cowpea is a highly drought-adapted leguminous crop with great
              promise for improving agricultural sustainability and food
              security. Here, we report analyses derived from array-based
              genotyping of 2,021 accessions constituting a core subset of the
              world's largest cowpea collection, held at the International
              Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) in Ibadan, Nigeria. We
              used this dataset to examine genetic variation and population
              structure in worldwide cowpea. We confirm that the primary
              pattern of population structure is two geographically defined
              subpopulations origining in West and East Africa, respectively,
              and that population structure is associated with shifts in
              phenotypic distribution. Furthermore, we establish the cowpea
              core collection as a resource for genome-wide association studies
              by mapping the genetic basis of several phenotypes, with a focus
              on seed coat pigmentation patterning and color. We anticipate
              that the genotyped IITA cowpea core collection will serve as a
              powerful tool for mapping complex traits, facilitating the
              acceleration of breeding programs to enhance the resilience of
              this crop in the face of rapid global climate change. \#\#\#
