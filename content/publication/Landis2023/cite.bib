  abstract = "Direct observation is central to our understanding of the process
              of adaptation, but evolution is rarely documented in a large,
              multicellular organism for more than a few generations. Here, we
              observe genetic and phenotypic evolution across a century-scale
              competition experiment, barley composite cross II (CCII). CCII
              was founded in 1929 in Davis, CA, USA with tens of thousands of
              unique genotypes. We find that natural selection has massively
              reduced genetic diversity leading to a single clonal lineage
              constituting the majority of the population by generation F50.
              Selection favored alleles originating from similar climates to
              that of Davis, and targeted genes regulating reproductive
              development, including some of the most well-characterized barley
              diversification loci, Vrs1, HvCEN, and Ppd-H1. We chronicle the
              dynamic evolution of reproductive timing in the population and
              uncover how parallel molecular pathways are targeted by
              stabilizing selection to optimize this trait. Our findings point
              to selection as the predominant force shaping genomic variation
              in one of the world's oldest ongoing biological experiments.
